# Project title: Citations in Public Space

## Link to proposal: [github](https://github.com/zotheo/group_project/blob/main/group%20assignments/readme.md)

### Roles:

#### Arrest Data Analysis Team: Zoe and Greer
The arrest data analysis team is looking at LAPD data on citations in public space and mapping those arrests by type. Some of the types of citation data we are looking at include; drinking in public, illegal street vending, and unpermitted events. To tighten our scope, we picked six neighborhoods to focus on in LA County. We used the Urban Displacement project’s Gentrification and Displacement map to identify two neighborhoods that are low-income/ susceptible to gentrification (Jefferson Park and Lincoln Heights), two that are undergoing or at advanced gentrification (Boyle Heights and Westlake), and two that are becoming exclusive (Los Feliz and Fairfax).  Zoe and Greer split this list in half and are each focusing on three distinct neighborhoods; tracking and mapping arrests in their defined neighborhoods. 
- **Zoe** is responsible for collecting information on arrests in; Jefferson Park, Los Feliz, and Westlake. 
- **Greer** is responsible for collecting information on arrests in; Lincoln Heights, Boyle Heights, and Fairfax. 

#### Gentrification Indicators Team: Iris and Erick
The Gentrification indicators team. They are responsible for collecting data on key gentrification indicators (foreclosures, evictions, changing demographics) and mapping them in the six neighborhoods we identified for this project. 
- **Erick** is responsible for looking at gentrification indicators in; Jefferson Park, Boyle Heights, and Los Feliz
- **Iris** is responsible for looking at gentrification indicators in; Lincoln Heights, Westlake, and Fairfax

### Status update:

The mood is positive, we are feeling good. We have a fairly clear idea of what we hope to accomplish in the next few weeks, and we are enthusiastic about making some cool maps. We are all running into frustrating error codes that can be time consuming, but it feels manageable. We will ask for help if we run into something that has us particularly stuck. 
Data update:
- **Iris**: To map income we will be using the social explorer to gather our data and query to track income change over time in years corresponding to our neighborhoods Tables - Social Explorer. We will also use census data to map race and ethnicity to track the disparities. 
- **Erick**: To map neighborhoods that are facing displacement we will be using the Urban Displacement project open source to help us focus on data that corresponds to our neighborhood mapping Open Source – Urban Displacement. To gather the LON and LAD from public spaces such as parks we will gather our data from the LA County Countywide Parks and Open Space (Public - Hosted) | Countywide Parks and Open Space (Public - Hosted) | County Of Los Angeles Enterprise GIS (arcgis.com). 
- **Zoe**: It is hard to tell if the data is incomplete if LAPD changed reporting protocol during the process of collecting and reporting data on these kinds of arrests because there are drastic changes in number of arrests between years. We may need to look a little deeper into reporting protocols and changing laws in order to fully understand trends in our data. 
- **Greer**: We had to figure out a way to filter the arrest data to just contain the information for our neighborhoods of interest. It had an “area” field but the areas were quite large and not specific enough for our purposes. We were able to use the “reporting district” or “rd” field. Using the LAPD website it was possible to identify which reporting districts fall into each neighborhood. 

### Concerns: 

**Major Concerns**
- Our arrest data might be incomplete – for the arrest types we are interested in, there is a sharp decline in the number of arrests after 2012. This trend holds true both in our neighborhoods we are investigating and across the dataset citywide. We need to do some research to see if this is due to a policy change or if the dataset for the later years is less complete. 
- Another main concern is how are we going to overlay our data information with other data such as using the crime data and overlay with public space while also incorporating gentrification indicators. 

**Minor Concerns**
- Our Public Space data from LA County only has parks and recreation locations but we notice that a plaza is not labeled as an open space which makes us assume that the data map may not be up to date. This can lead to a misinformation of mapping public space but does not seem like a major concern. 
- We have selected a set of arrest types that we think are related to use of public space. We still need to confirm which types we want to include in the analysis.
