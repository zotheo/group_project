# Project Proposal 

## Introduction to Research Question 

For this project, our group will look at the reclamation of public space and the relationship it has to gentrification and displacement in Los Angeles. We plan to collect data on instances of the public reclaiming space through “unsanctioned” uses of the public realm, this could be; illegal street vending, unpermitted events like side shows and concerts, and/or public drinking over time and compare this to instances of gentrification and displacement. We are aiming to understand if decreases in instances of unsanctioned uses of the public realm are associated with the displacement of low-income and BIPOC residents in Los Angeles. 

## Why are we studying this?

This study is essential because displacement has a significant impact on communities that affects their housing conditions, health, security, livelihoods, and education. This leads to perpetual barriers in low-income communities being revitalized, making it unaffordable to live in their newly redeveloped community, forcing them to be pushed to other communities that lack community amenities. One of the major amenities in communities is public spaces that are meant for entertainment and practicing leisure activities. Having public space is vital to communities that lack space in their homes. For example, apartments are very limited in space, so having parks or plazas is beneficial for communities to get away from home and practice recreational activities. However, if communities are being pushed out, what is left of the public spaces becomes public deserts. 


## Spatial Scope

We intend to examine the city of Los Angeles between 2010 and 2019. In the wake of hyper-commodification of housing, cities around the world have faced a mass amount of displacement due to an increase in speculative development resulting in gentrification over the last few decades. We seek to track how Los Angeles has changed during 2010-2019, which tracks the years and subsequent impacts following the 2008 housing crisis and leads up to Covid (which has had its own spatial impacts). It feels crucial to examine Los Angeles over this timeframe to gain an understanding of changes in social space that have defined our contextual habitat.

## Data Sets

### Informal Use of Public Space 
**Arrest Data LAPD**
- Source: [Los Angeles Police Department via City of Los Angeles Data Catalog](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-2019/yru6-6re4)
- Description: This data set includes all arrest data between 2010 and 2019. There are specific arrest types that are relevant to our interest in use of public space. There are various types of arrests that will potentially be of interest to us including: 
Open alcoholic beverage in a public place/park, Drinking in public , Play bball/games on sidewalk/street, Reckless driving, Impeding normal flow of traffic 
- Relevance to our project: We will use this data to understand trends in citations for use of public space in neighborhoods experiencing change (as defined by our indicators.)  

**Street Vending Citations**
- Source: [Los Angeles Police Department via City of Los Angeles Data Catalog](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Street-Vending-Citations-LAMC-42-00/7fnr-292v)
- Description: This data includes citations for street vending (which is the charge 42.00BLAMC – Illegal Street/Sidewalk Sales) from 2010 to 2019. The data has both the area name and the cross streets where the citation was issued. We will need to geocode the cross streets for our use of this dataset. 
- Relevance to our project: We will use this data to understand trends in vending citations in neighborhoods experiencing change (as defined by our indicators.)  

**LA Parks map**
- [Countywide Parks and Open Space (Public - Hosted)](https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/lacounty::countywide-parks-and-open-space-public-hosted/explore?location=34.051025%2C-118.218398%2C13.20)

### Displacement / Gentrification Indicators ###
**Foreclosures**
- Source: Neighborhood Data for Social Change (USC Price School)
- Description: This data source includes foreclosures on the neighborhood and Census Tract level in the City of Los Angeles between 2014 and 2021. The eviction data comes from Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD) as point data and the Neighborhood Data for Social Change team geocoded the evictions to 2020 Census Tracts. 
- Relevance to our project: We will use this data as an indicator of neighborhood change, specifically housing displacement. 

**Evictions**
- Source: [Neighborhood Data for Social Change (USC Price School)](https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/2021/06/foreclosures/)
Description: This data source includes Ellis Act evictions on the neighborhood and Census Tract level in the City of Los Angeles between 2010 and 2021. The eviction data comes from LAHD as point data and the Neighborhood Data for Social Change team geocoded the evictions to 2020 Census Tracts. 
Relevance to our project: We will use this data as an indicator of neighborhood change, specifically housing displacement. 

**Median Gross Rent**
- Source: [Neighborhood Data for Social Change (USC Price School)](https://la.myneighborhooddata.org/2022/12/ellis-act-evictions/)
- Description: This data source includes median rent on the neighborhood and Census Tract level in the City of Los Angeles between 2010 and 2021. The median rent metric includes the cost of rent plus utilities. The underlying data is from the American Community Survey 
- Relevance to our project: We will use this data as an indicator of neighborhood change, specifically rising cost of living. 

**Poverty data**

## Analysis

We intend to analyze police reports in search of various citations such as: illegal vending, drinking in public, reckless driving, and others as listed above. We will compare the location of citations to mark areas with notable changes in gentrification indicators which may include race, foreclosures, evictions and median gross rent among others. We hope that this data will allow us to produce maps that speak to the relationship between unsanctioned uses of public space and gentrification. 

## Conclusion

In a time where seemingly every inch of space has been commodified, and collective or social ownership of land has disappeared, resistance through reclamation of public space is crucial. We argue that street food, underground music, sideshows and parties are forms of spatial reclamation that resist gentrification. By examining “unsanctioned” uses of public land we hope to gain insight into the ways in which these instances of resistance have been impacted over time.
